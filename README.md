## ðŸª„ Setup Instructions

### 1âƒ£ Step 1: Install Ollama and Run a Model

> Ollama allows you to run LLMs like `gemma`, `llama3`, or `mistral` locally.

#### â–¶ Install Ollama

**For Windows / macOS / Linux:**
Go to [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) and follow the platform-specific installation instructions.

#### â–¶ Pull the model (e.g., Gemma 4B)

```bash
ollama pull gemma:4b
```

You can also run:

```bash
ollama run gemma:4b
```

Make sure it's accessible at `http://localhost:11434`.

### 2âƒ£ Step 2: Install Moya Framework

Moya is on PyPI, but install it from source is recommended:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moyahq/moya.git
cd moya
pip install .
```

> Make sure Moya's modules like `moya.agents`, `moya.orchestrators`, etc. are accessible.

---

### 3âƒ£ Step 3: Install Project Requirements

From your project root directory, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `winotify` fails (on Linux/macOS), comment it out in the `requirements.txt` or install only on Windows.
